My undergraduate research is [Multi-robot Shark Tracking](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/shark-tracking-with-auvs/){:target="\_blank"}. This NSF-funded project was a collaboration between my lab, [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu){:target="\_blank"}, and the [Shark Lab](https://www.csulb.edu/shark-lab){:target="\_blank"} at the California State Univsesity, Long Beach (CSULB).

In summer 2015, I was grateful to be selected as an <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/wrigleysummerfellowship/">USC Wrigley Summer Fellow</a>, and spent a summer at Catalina Island to perform field tests. Below are video footages of our experiments.

### Takeaways:
  1. The world is not perfect. There are un-modeled noises and **disturbances**.
  2. Field experiments are expensive. **Preparations** are very important.
  3. Impromptu **problem solving** skills (hacks) are very useful.
  4. **Simulations** are also important.
