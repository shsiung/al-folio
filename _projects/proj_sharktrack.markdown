My undergraduate research is [Multi-robot Shark Tracking](https://www.lair.hmc.edu/shark-tracking-with-auvs/){:target="\_blank"}. This NSF-funded project was a collaboration between my lab, [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu){:target="\_blank"}, and the [Shark Lab](https://www.csulb.edu/shark-lab){:target="\_blank"} at the California State Univsesity, Long Beach (CSULB).

For the summer 2015, I was grateful to be selected as an <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/wrigley/wrigleysummerfellowship/">USC Wrigley Summer Fellow</a>, and spent a summer at Catalina Island to perform field tests. Below shows some video footages we performed and filmed by a drone.
