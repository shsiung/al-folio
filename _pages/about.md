I graduated from the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University as a Master of Robotics student in August 2018. 
I was a member of the [Robot Perception Lab (RPL)](http://rpl.ri.cmu.edu){:target="\_blank"} under the supervision of Prof. Michael Kaess.

My research interests lie in the intersection of information theory, probabilistic theory and nonlinear optimization in the applications 
of mobile robotics. During my time at RPL, my research focused on improving optimization methods in visual-inertial state estimation. 

Prior to CMU, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Harvey Mudd College, where I was a member of the [Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)](https://www.lair.hmc.edu){:target="\_blank"}.
